# Game concept
Generates a random beat that it will play 4/4 time starting at 60 bpm and increasing at a rate of 10 bpm per level with two tones. Each level generates a random beat with notes between 1/8 and 1 beat. The beat will play through the speakers and then you will have to press the button at that rate with the low note being the left button and the high note being the right button. After you play it the pixels will flash green if you get it and red if you fail. It will then play another round increasing the BPM if you completed the previous round. 

# Notes
When the pixels are rotating and yellow. that is each beat. When blue, it is your turn to play. 
Sounds that are neither of the original tones are marks for the beginning and end of the measure. 
# Inputs:
Left button
